[entity-description]
logistic_belt-device=Logistic belt controller that control the flow of item through a portion of belt 
logistic_belt-sushi=Sushi belt controller, an easy way to create a sushi belt
logistic_belt-router=A chest that propagates the requests, also shares its contents with its neighbour routers. Support filters.

[mod-setting-name]
logistic_belt-link_to_output_chest=Auto wire to output chest
logistic_belt-is_input_filtered=Filter on input device
logistic_belt-item_count=Max count of item in sushi belt
logistic_belt-request_count=Maximum of request for a device
logistic_belt-add_filter=Add filter to all chests
logistic_belt-router_inventory_size=Inventory size of a router


[mod-setting-description]
logistic_belt-link_to_output_chest=When a network is built, the output device is wired to the output chest to get existing stock
logistic_belt-is_input_filtered=Add additionnal computation and a connection to the input chest in order to filter only the items that are available (prevent freeze if there are more than 5 items missing)
logistic_belt-item_count=Max count of item in sushi belt
logistic_belt-request_count=Maximum of request for a device
logistic_belt-add_filter=Add filter to all chests (normal, logistic, infinity)
logistic_belt-router_inventory_size=Inventory size of a router

[tooltip]
logistic_belt-request=Item to request on belt
logistic_belt-request-count=Count of item to request on belt
logistic_belt-lane-item=Item to send on belt
logistic_belt-is_input_filtered=Add additionnal computation and a connection to the input chest in order to filter only the items that are available (prevent freeze if there are more than 5 items missing)
logistic_belt-link_to_output_chest=When a network is built, the output device is wired to the output chest to get existing stock
logistic_belt-is_slow=Slow mode. Limit throughput to have a more accurate couting of items.
logistic_belt-is_requested_disconnected=If set, the request are not propagated from the output to the input
is_requested_disconnected=The requested from other device are not propagated. This may avoid a loop in the network.
logistic_belt-is_overflow=In overflow mode, the items in the container whose count exceed the input value are sent on the belt
